/**
 * This is the main interface for the API, let's talk about that.
 *
 * The actual API calls are organized by the type of request (district, event, match, team, other), which can be found
 * in the requests package. Essentially, TBA is a single class that allows you to call every single method without having
 * to worry about what type it is. However, for debugging, it's nice to keep the actual API code organized by type.
 * You'll notice that TBA doesn't have any getters/setters/constructors for parameters, even though only a couple parameters are
 * shared across the entire API. There are several reasons for this, 1) to keep the Java implementation more consistent with the
 * online API 2) if you need to change parameters or input different ones for each method calls, it's nice to avoid having to
 * manually setting them with setters and the like. However, if you'd like a constructor/setter/getter implementation, check out the CTBA class.
